# pseudo-assembler-implementation-in-C
This application simulates an assembler: 
it receives input files written in a pseudo predefined assembly language, 
parses them, separating data section from code section, 
managing symbols table, internal and exteranl refereneces, etc,
converts it to binary code and then finally produces as output the object file in hexa-decimal base code, 
error report file (if any), entry file, and external reference file. 

the "Project Decription.pdf" file (included in the zip file), 
includes a full decsription of the application requirements specification.
